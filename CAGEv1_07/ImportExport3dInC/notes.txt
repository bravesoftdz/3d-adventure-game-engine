These python scripts are intended for blender 2.49b

"c_export.py" and c_import.py are python scripts for blender that will allow you to export and import c source code. Put the scripts where your python scripts are for blender.

Maybe for Linux:
/usr/share/blender/scripts/blender

Maybe for Windows:
C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender\x.x\scripts
or
C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\.blender\scripts

Place the scripts in the correct directory then start blender and go to the "Scripts Window", click "Scripts" then "Update Menus".
